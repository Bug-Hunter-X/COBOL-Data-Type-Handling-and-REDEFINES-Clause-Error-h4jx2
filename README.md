This example demonstrates a common COBOL error related to data type handling and the use of the REDEFINES clause. The program moves a numeric value to a field defined as alphanumeric, resulting in potential data truncation or unexpected output. The solution shows how to correctly handle this scenario by ensuring data type compatibility.
